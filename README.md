# GEISTFELD
## Top-down survival horror featuring hand-drawn art & asynchronous multiplayer!

A 2D survival-horror game made for Godot Wild Jam #74 with the theme of "Haunted"!
Players awaken in the Geistfeld, a strange, haunted field and must fix a broken trap-door
to descend out of the field. All the while, a Ghost wanders the field and will try to
chase you to your death.

However, death is not the end! Upon dying, players will have the option to leave behind a
Wisp o' Blessings to offer a message and assistance to the next player.
